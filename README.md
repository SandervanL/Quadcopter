# Drone
The code for my quadcopter.
The main file the quadcopter is going to run on is testBareFinalDrone.ino
The files on which this file relies are either within the 'libraries' directory, or within the Arduino IDE as standard library.

The Arduino-Quadcopter is quadcopter software based on the Arduino UNO R3 (ATmega328p).
The Arduino101-Quadcopter is the same software, but adapted for the Arduino 101.
Compile the code by making the downloaded folder the Sketchbook Location of your Android IDE (File->Preferences->Sketchbook Location).
Everything should run normally.
